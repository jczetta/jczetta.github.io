Source material from [a demo (source UMich-specific)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xq-OPr3_vrZIeifQZGZq28BPMoaZ58tAQsUUfZi4Tqc/edit?usp=sharing) I wrote and delivered to a junior faculty meeting at the University of Michigan School of Information, on use of the [Gradescope](http://gradescope.com/) tool.
