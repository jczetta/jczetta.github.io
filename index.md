I am currently an Engineering Manager at the Democratic National Committee.

I'm an engineer (and teacher always). I love building and managing great teams, and I like to have a role in building tech that makes people's lives easier, better, and/or more fun. I enjoy being part of teams who learn from each other, try new things, and ship.

I've worked in research labs, startups, and in civic technology, but in my "past life" I was a lecturer and researched computing education. 

You can find more about me and my work at the surrounding links.
