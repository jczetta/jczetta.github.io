I am currently an Engineering Manager at the [Democratic National Committee Tech Team](https://democrats.org/dnc-tech/).

I'm a software engineer (and teacher always). I love building and managing great teams, and I like to have a role in building tech that makes people's lives easier, better, and/or more fun. I enjoy being part of teams who learn from each other, try new things, and ship.
      
I've worked in research labs, startups, and in civic technology, but in my "past life" I was a lecturer and researched computing education.
      
I used to use Twitter, but not lately; you can find me on Mastodon at <a href="https://vis.social/@jczetta">jczetta@vis.social</a> occasionally. 

My personal GitHub is separate from my work GitHub so it's pretty sparse these days -- when I'm not working, I'm often bookbinding, working with film (photography), biking, something involving food, or hanging out with my partner and our cat.

You can find more about me at the surrounding links, or reach out: jczetta at gmail.
