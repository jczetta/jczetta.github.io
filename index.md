I am currently a Lecturer III at the University of Michigan School of Information.

My work focuses on curriculum architecture and course material development and design -- particularly for computer programming, computer science, data analysis, statistical interpretation, and other types of symbolic systems and storytelling. I also study and work on overall best practices for teaching and learning in high school, higher ed, & continuing education of all kinds, and I build and fix software to help people solve problems.

I love building and managing great teams, and working toward fixing things, and I am happy to connect re: topics of mutual interest (political, sociological, educational, or otherwise).

You can find more about me and my work at the surrounding links.
