I am currently a Lecturer III at the University of Michigan School of Information.

My work focuses on curriculum architecture and course material development and design -- particularly for computer programming, computer science, and other types of symbolic systems -- and on overall best practices for teaching and learning in high school and in higher & continuing education of all kinds.

I otherwise enjoy learning, teaching, and solving problems of all kinds.
