I am currently the Director of Engineering at the NYC Digital Service, within the <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/content/oti/pages/#our-work" target="_blank" alt="link to Office of Technology and Innovation website">NYC Office of Technology and Innovation</a>.

I’m a software engineer and a teacher. I love building great teams. I like to have a role in building tech that makes people’s lives easier, better, and/or more fun. I enjoy being part of teams who learn from each other, try new things, and ship – both at companies and in the classroom. I live in (and love) New York City.

I've been:

* an Engineering Manager at the <a href="https://democrats.org/dnc-tech/" target="_blank" alt="page describing DNC Tech Team" >Democratic National Committee Tech Team</a>, 
* a faculty member at the <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/" target="_blank" alt="to University website">University of Michigan School of Information</a>, 
* the Director of the <a href="https://witny-summer-guild-2018.github.io/" target="_blank" alt="the website describing the 2018 summer guild program I designed">Summer Guild</a> pre-college computing program,
* an instructor in the University of Michigan <a href="https://online.umich.edu/series/python-3-programming/" alt="coursera specialization home page" target="_blank">Python 3 Specialization on Coursera</a>,
* a software engineer at an e-commerce startup

I used to use Twitter, but not much lately. You can find me on Mastodon at <a href="https://med-mastodon.com/@jczetta">jczetta@med-mastodon.com</a> (40% public health stuff, 60% other) occasionally. 

My personal GitHub is separate from my work GitHub so it's pretty sparse these days. when I'm not working, I'm often bookbinding, working with film (photography), biking, something involving food or coffee, or hanging out with my partner and our cat. 

I don't maintain this website much, but you can find more about me at the above links, or reach out: jczetta at gmail.
