I am currently the Director of Engineering at the NYC Digital Service, within the <a href="" alt="link to Office of Technology and Innovation website">NYC Office of Technology and Innovation</a>.

Previously, I was an Engineering Manager at the <a href="https://democrats.org/dnc-tech/" alt="link to page describing DNC Tech Team" >Democratic National Committee Tech Team</a>, a faculty member at the <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/">University of Michigan School of Information</a>, and the Co-Director of the <a href="https://witny-summer-guild-2018.github.io/">Summer Guild</a> pre-college computing program.

I'm a software engineer and a teacher. I love building great teams. I like to have a role in building tech that makes people's lives easier, better, and/or more fun. I enjoy being part of teams who learn from each other, try new things, and ship -- both at companies and in the classroom.
      
I've worked in research labs, startups, and in civic technology. I've taught all levels of computer programming and related topics to college students (teaching was my full-time job for almost 10 years), which informs all of my work, and I used to research computing education.
      
I also used to use Twitter, but not much lately. You can find me on Mastodon at <a href="https://med-mastodon.com/@jczetta">jczetta@med-mastodon.com</a> (40% public health stuff, 60% other) occasionally. 

My personal GitHub is separate from my work GitHub so it's pretty sparse these days -- when I'm not working, I'm often bookbinding, working with film (photography), biking, something involving food, or hanging out with my partner and our cat. 

I don't maintain this website much, but you can find more about me at the surrounding links, or reach out: jczetta at gmail.
