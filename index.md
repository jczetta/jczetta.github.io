I am currently a Lecturer III at the University of Michigan School of Information.

My work focuses on curriculum architecture and course material development and design -- particularly for computer programming, computer science, and other types of symbolic systems -- and on overall best practices for teaching and learning in high school and in higher & continuing education of all kinds.

I love solving problems, building great teams, and working toward fixing things, and I am happy to connect re: topics of mutual interest (political, sociological, educational, or otherwise).

You can find more about me and my work at the surrounding links.
