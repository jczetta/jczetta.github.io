# Lesson subject

Object-Oriented Programming (in Python): what, why, how to approach using it (an introduction)


# Lesson agenda
- Introduce some motivations for Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - ~*10 minutes*
- Examine and understand code for defining objects in Python (as a first example) - ~*15 minutes*
- Unpack some useful analogies for OOP & review fundamental ideas behind OOP  - ~*20 minutes*
- Review our goals for object-oriented programming - ~*5 minutes*
- Examine implementation of an object in a program - *~20 minutes*
- Wrap-up and preview of our next goals - *~10 minutes*


# Students’ previous knowledge
- Python syntax basics — indentation, callable objects, assignment, order of operations
- Python function definitions and function invocations
- Control statements:
  - Conditional statements
  - For loops (definite iteration) & its use in Python
  - While loops (indefinite iteration)
- Data types and associated methods:
  - Integers
  - Floats
  - Strings
  - Lists
  - Tuples
  - Dictionaries
- Structuring “simple”/medium-simple one-file programs
  - Defining and invoking functions on data created inside the program
  - Constructing steps — e.g. building dictionaries, creating lists of dictionaries, invoking functions on dictionaries, using dictionaries to represent objects


# Notes on formatting

I’ve included headers for sections that instructors can think of as topics to address,

# Like so

but a few of the topics in the agenda are actually composed of a couple large headers of information to distinguish them for clarity both for instructors and for students.

I’ve also included sub-headers to indicate specific foci within the larger topics,

## Like so

All code is in code-specific boxes, like so:

```python
print("This is code") #Syntax coloring may vary slightly
```

Specific code-pieces are sometimes highlighted in non-syntax-colored monospace: `like so`

Finally, *italics* indicate information for an instructor that isn’t useful in this *particular* situation (where me, teaching, is also the writer of the lesson plan), and there are some sections showing descriptions of what I think should accompany the lesson but not show up in a display for students, in note format
